## History & Solution :bell:

Once there had been a bell system in schools, which was to be rung manually using hands. As time progressed, there came an electric bell system. Then, most of the schools adapted this electric bell system. Even though this system is quite better than the conventional method, it also needs a dedicated manpower for pressing the button of the bell manually time to time.
